        We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

        We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

        In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

      Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

    %h3.privacyhdr Website Visitors
    %p
      Like most website operators, COMPANYNAME collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. COMPANYNAME's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how COMPANYNAME's visitors use its website. From time to time, COMPANYNAME may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    %p
      COMPANYNAME also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. COMPANYNAME does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

    %h3.privacyhdr Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    %p
      Certain visitors to COMPANYNAME's websites choose to interact with COMPANYNAME in ways that require COMPANYNAME to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that COMPANYNAME gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at COMPANYNAME to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with COMPANYNAME are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, COMPANYNAME collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with COMPANYNAME. COMPANYNAME does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

    %h3.privacyhdr Aggregated Statistics
    %p
      COMPANYNAME may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, COMPANYNAME may monitor the most popular bands on the COMPANYNAME site or use spam screened to help identify spam. COMPANYNAME may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, COMPANYNAME does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

    %h3.privacyhdr Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
    %p
      COMPANYNAME discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on COMPANYNAME's behalf or to provide services available at COMPANYNAME's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using COMPANYNAME's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. COMPANYNAME will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, COMPANYNAME discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when COMPANYNAME believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of COMPANYNAME, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an COMPANYNAME website and have supplied your email address, COMPANYNAME may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with COMPANYNAME and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. COMPANYNAME takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

    %h3.privacyhdr Cookies
    %p
      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. COMPANYNAME uses cookies to help COMPANYNAME identify and track visitors, their usage of COMPANYNAME website, and their website access preferences. COMPANYNAME visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using COMPANYNAME's websites, with the drawback that certain features of COMPANYNAME's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

    %h3.privacyhdr Privacy Policy Changes
    %p
      Although most changes are likely to be minor, COMPANYNAME may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in COMPANYNAME's sole discretion. COMPANYNAME encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a COMPANYNAME account, you should also check your accounts dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
